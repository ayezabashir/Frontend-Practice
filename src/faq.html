          <summary>What is Frontend Practice?</summary>
          <p>
            Frontend Practice offers developers the opportunity to practice and
            improve their skills in design, interactions, animations,
            responsiveness, troubleshooting, and more by providing a selection
            of real websites for them to recreate from scratch. This hands-on
            approach allows developers to gain a diverse set of valuable skills
            that will make them more employable in the industry.

        <details class="question">
          <summary>Where is the code?</summary>
          <p>
            Frontend Practice does not provide any pre-written code, but we do
            offer a few resources to assist with each project. However, there
            will always be unexpected challenges that arise during the learning
            process, which is where the true learning begins.

        <details class="question">
          <summary>Which languages do I use for these projects?</summary>
          <p>
            In short, you can use any programming language you desire for these
            practice projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beauty of recreating websites for practice is that you can
            utilize any tech stack, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue,
            Angular, Svelte, or any other language, framework, or library.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="question">
          <summary>Why did you pick these websites?</summary>
          <p>
            The selection of websites featured on Frontend Practice is based on
            personal preference and takes into consideration various factors,
            including design and style, difficulty to recreate, and elements and
            features that offer a learning opportunity through recreation.

              It is important to note that some projects may be more challenging
              to recreate than others.

        <details class="question">
          <summary>Can I use these in my portfolio?</summary>
          <p>
            We encourage you to make these projects your own by incorporating
            your own colors, content, and images. If you choose to use these
            projects for your portfolio, please clearly state that it is an
            "unofficial" version.

              materials owned by companies and individuals whose websites are
              featured on Frontend Practice are intended for practice purposes

          <summary>
            Why does the live website not look like the project anymore?
          </summary>
          <p>
            How dare they update the website! We will talk with their manager
            right away. If they don't respond, we'll periodically check the
            websites we feature and make the necessary updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, if we really love the previous design, we may keep it
            and link to an archived page if possible. If not, please see the
            reference image on the project page.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="question">
          <summary>Where did some of the projects go?</summary>
          <p>
            Occasionally we will retire projects from the main collection if the
            design is no longer up to date or an archived version is not
            available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >You can still find the retired projects at the bottom of our
              <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.</strong
